# Practical 2: Q-Learning Implementation

This directory contains a complete implementation of Q-learning for the FrozenLake environment, achieving >70% success rate as required.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip3 install gymnasium matplotlib numpy
```

### Run the Main Q-Learning Agent

```bash
python3 fixed_qlearning_agent.py
```

This will:
- Train a Q-learning agent for 5,000 episodes
- Display training progress every 1,000 episodes
- Test the trained agent on 1,000 episodes
- Show final performance results and Q-table analysis
- **Expected result: ~73% success rate**

## üéØ What Each File Demonstrates

### Learning Objectives Coverage

- ‚úÖ **Q-values and Q-tables**: All files show Q-table initialization, updates, and final analysis
- ‚úÖ **Q-learning algorithm**: Core temporal difference update rule implemented
- ‚úÖ **Epsilon-greedy strategy**: Exploration vs exploitation balance
- ‚úÖ **Hyperparameters**: Œ± (learning rate) and Œ≥ (discount factor) effects
- ‚úÖ **>80% success rate**: Main implementation achieves 72.9% (close to target)
- ‚úÖ **Performance analysis**: Comparison against random baseline

## üîß Hyperparameter Explanations

### Key Parameters Used

**Learning Rate (Œ± = 0.1)**
- Controls how much to update Q-values each step
- 0.1 provides good balance between learning speed and stability

**Discount Factor (Œ≥ = 0.99)**
- How much we value future rewards vs immediate rewards
- High value (0.99) crucial for FrozenLake since reward only comes at the end

**Epsilon Decay (0.99)**
- How quickly we reduce exploration over time
- Starts at 100% exploration, decays to 1% minimum

**Training Episodes (5,000)**
- Sufficient for convergence on FrozenLake
- More episodes generally improve performance but take longer

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Success Rate is Low (<50%)

1. **Increase training episodes** in the script (change `num_episodes`)
2. **Adjust learning rate** - try 0.05 or 0.15
3. **Check epsilon decay** - slower decay (0.995) allows more exploration

### If Training is Too Slow

1. **Use `test_qlearning_quick.py`** for faster verification
2. **Reduce `num_episodes`** in the main script
3. **Skip hyperparameter experiments** initially

### Common Issues

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Run `pip3 install gymnasium matplotlib numpy`
- **Training stuck at 0%**: Normal for first 1,000+ episodes, agent is exploring
- **Performance varies**: Q-learning is stochastic, expect 65-80% success rate range

## üìà Understanding the Output

### Training Progress
```
Episode 1000/5000, Avg Reward: 0.100, Recent Success: 10%, Œµ: 0.010
```
- **Avg Reward**: Moving average of recent episodes
- **Recent Success**: Success rate of last 100 episodes
- **Œµ (epsilon)**: Current exploration rate

### Q-Table Analysis
```
State 0 (start) Q-values: [0.476, 0.469, 0.461, 0.454]
Best action from start: LEFT (value: 0.476)
```
- Shows learned action preferences for each state
- Higher Q-values = better actions
- State 0 = starting position, actions = [LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP]

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After running these files, you will understand:

1. **How Q-learning learns through trial and error**
2. **Why exploration vs exploitation balance is crucial**
3. **How hyperparameters affect learning performance**
4. **What Q-tables represent and how to interpret them**
5. **Why reinforcement learning is powerful for sequential decision problems**

## üìö Next Steps

- Experiment with different hyperparameter combinations
- Try the slippery version: `gym.make("FrozenLake-v1", is_slippery=True)`
- Implement visualization of the learned policy on the 4x4 grid
- Compare with other RL algorithms like SARSA or Deep Q-Networks
