# MLA202 Reinforcement Learning

## Module Information

- **Module Code and Title**: MLA202 Reinforcement Learning
- **Programme**: Bachelor of Business Intelligence
- **Credit Value**: 12
- **Module Tutors**: Sonam Jamtsho, Dawa Zangmo, Tshering Pem, Yeshi Lhazom
- **Module Coordinator**: TBA

## Synopsis

The module provides a comprehensive exploration of autonomous decision-making. Beginning with basic concepts and the exploration-exploitation dilemma, learners delve into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Dynamic Programming (DP) for planning. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning introduces value functions, Monte Carlo Methods, and Temporal Difference (TD) learning, paving the way for deep understanding of exploration-exploitation strategies and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

Real-world applications in Business Analytics, including dynamic pricing and risk analysis, are explored alongside ethical considerations. Through theoretical frameworks and practical applications, learners gain insights into the potential and societal impacts of Reinforcement Learning in diverse domains, empowering them to navigate the complexities of intelligent decision-making.

## General Objective

This module aims to develop students' competence in reinforcement learning. The students will be able to create models based on reinforcement learning and use them to solve real world problems.

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the module, students will be able to:

1. Explain key elements of reinforcement learning (RL)
2. Differentiate between different types of RL
3. Explain Markov Decision Process and Bellman Equations
4. Perform planning in RL using Dynamic programming
5. Apply Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Methods
6. Create Deep Q-Networks
7. Apply RL methods in business analytics and business intelligence
